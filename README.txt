1e The initial conc. for the fixed metabolites are taken from Bill's /Users/kuma889/Projects/Boltzmann/Boltz/neurospora_no_regulation_old/neurospora_pentose_phos.glycolysis.tca_concs.in file and he has taken these from Benett's paper. 

-------- The concentrations for all of the fixed compounds are mostly from the Bennett paper. So take them with a grain of salt in that they are whole-cell measurements where we really want to use concentrations of compounds that are free (not bound to proteins). That being said, it runs OK but with driving force that is probably smaller than the actual driving force.
